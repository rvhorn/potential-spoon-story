There once was a farmer named Bill. Bill was a kind wonderful old soul 
who loved the open plains and the farm land. He was never quite certain 
what about the fields of the Midwest that he loved so very dearly. You 
see Bill was a humble dairy farmer from the great state of Wisconsin. Where 
Bill lived there where fields of cows as far as the eye could see. Like a 
black and white swarm the cows peacefully wandered across Bill's farm.
