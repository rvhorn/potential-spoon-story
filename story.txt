There once was a farmer named Bill. Bill was a kind wonderful old soul
who loved the open plains and the farm land. He was never quite certain
what about the fields of the Midwest that he loved so very dearly. You
see Bill was a humble dairy farmer from the great state of Wisconsin. Where
Bill lived there where fields of cows as far as the eye could see. Like a
black and white swarm the cows peacefully wandered across Bill's farm.

One cow in the heard was named Melissa. Melissa wasn't the smartest of the bunch,
but she was Bill's favorite. Melissa was easily recognizable as she is
completely white except for the one and only black splotch on her back.
Melissa held a special place in Bill's heart.

One dog in the heard was named Bobby. Bobby was the honest,
and smartest dog in Wisconsin. He protected Bill and this heard. 

Bobby was such a good boy that eventually he got turned into the God of Dogs 
and used his power to be such a good boy. He made everyone very, very happy 
and that made everyone very happy. 

Bobby made everyone so happy everyone went to buy a pizza. This however caused many people to develop diabetes. pizza stores were forced to shut down
